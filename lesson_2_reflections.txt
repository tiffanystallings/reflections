What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	An empty git repository is created. This tells git to start up in this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is information not yet committed, whereas the working directory and repository are already committed. This allows flexibility in making the decision of how much to change in one commit.
